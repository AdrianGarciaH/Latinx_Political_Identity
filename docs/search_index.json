[["index.html", "Latinx Political Identity Chapter 1 Introduction", " Latinx Political Identity Adrian Garcia Hernandez, Mendel Branover 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction For this project we have chosen to explore possible relationships between identity and the political views of Latin Americans in the United States. In the current political climate, one often hears references to the Latino vote, an assumption that claims Latin Americans act as one. In reality, the Latin American population is highly diverse and composed of immigrants from many countries in South America as well as a large population of American born Latin American citizens. We hope to explore the multiple facets of the Latin American experience and display the diversity and intersectionality of the largest minority group in the country. Specifically, we want to explore whether different subgroups of Latin Americans have different political preferences. To guide this work, we have decided to focus on the following questions: Is there a relationship between the birth status of Latin Americans in the U.S. and their political views? Are Latin Americans born in the U.S. more or less likely to support the Republican party? Moreover, for foreign-born Latin Americans, is there a relationship between their birth country and their political preferences? Does experiencing discrimination based on ethnic identity lead to more liberal political views (as exemplified by supporting the Democratic party)? Furthermore, are people who have experienced discrimination more likely to embrace gender-neutral ways of expressing the Latin experience? What influence does language proficiency have on political preference? Is there a relationship between Spanish fluency and people’s views on the importance of certain cultural signifiers to the Latin American experience? To explore these questions, we’ve produced a series of visualizations using data collected through a large survey of Latin Americans by the Pew Research Center. In the next few chapters, we will discuss our data source, data manipulations, and the results of our exploratory analysis. A note on terminology: The terms Latin American, Latino, Hispanic, and Latinx will be used interchangeably to refer to the population of residents of the United States who trace their origins or descent to any county of Latin America. Latinx is a gender-neutral alternative to the gendered forms Latino/Latina that is not recognized by the Royal Spanish Academy of Language but is nonetheless used by speakers wishing to use a more inclusive term to describe themselves. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Survey Origins 2.2 Target Population 2.3 Dataset Description 2.4 Issues With Our Data", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Survey Origins The source of data for this project was the 2019 National Survey of Latinos carried out by the Ipsos Public Affairs Research institute on behalf of the Pew Research Center. The Pew Research Center conducts public opinion polling and demographic research with the goal of informing the American public about the trends and issues at the forefront of the American political and social climate. They are non-partisan, self-described ‘fact thank’, non-profit organization and therefore a reliable, unbiased source of information. This survey was the 58th wave of the American Trends Panel survey and consisted of 3030 panel members who were presented with an extensive survey in a mostly digital format from December 3, 2019 to December 22, 2019. It was presented both in English and Spanish depending on the respondents’ preference and thus encompasses the views of Latino’s who are not English speakers. 2.2 Target Population The target population for the survey consisted of non-institutionalized adults (age 18 and over), residing in the United States. The sample was chosen through KnowledgePanel, an online, probability-based recruitment tool that allowed for a random selection of survey takers so that the results can be said to properly represent the U.S. Hispanic population. 2.3 Dataset Description The dataset itself includes 3030 entries, one for each survey participant. It contains 110 columns or variables encoding a response to each of the questions presented on the survey. All responses are encoded as factors (with the exception of the respondent’s age and, if born outside the U.S., the number of years residing in the U.S.). It includes information on such topics as the respondents political preference, ethnic self-identification, birth status, age, educational level, Spanish and English proficiency, expereince with ethinic-based discrimination, opinions regarding the importance of particular cultural signifiers, and broad opinions about the Trump administration. For our project, we decided to ignore the data regarding the Trump administration. We were mostly interested in overall political preference and felt equating political preference with approval of the Trump administration would skew our results due to the controversial nature of the Trump administration. Once this information was filtered out, we were left with a dataset of 3030 entries and 67 possible variables of interest to explore. 2.4 Issues With Our Data The main issue with this dataset was the fact that the great majority of variables included are categorical and thus limited our graph visualization possibilities. Moreover, certain variables such as political preference were constructed by the survey administrators based on the respondents’ responses to previous questions. Therefore there is a possibility that political preference assigned to a respondent might not completely align with the respondent’s political self-identification. However, we have no reason to fear there was bias in the assignment of political preference as the Pew Research Institute is a non-partisan organization. A possible other source of bias on our analysis of political preference came from the nature of the survey sample since only residents over 18 years old were included. This means that we don’t have data on younger generations of Latin Americans. Therefore, we are not able to explore whether the generations that will come into voting age in the next few years have a preference for a political party over another. Moreover, since there is a probability that younger respondents are more open to gender-neutral terms such as Latinx, our analysis of the approval of this term by the Latin American population is somewhat flawed. Lastly, as explored in the Missing Data chapter, the survey was constructed in such a way that certain questions were only presented to some respondents conditionally. Meaning that a negative response on a gateway question resulted in multiple ‘NA’ values on subsequent questions. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Our dataset was heavily pre-processed by the researchers at the Pew Research Center and so very little data transformation was required for our project. We primarily relied on grouping and filtering the dataset based on characteristics of interest for each of our questions. The only true data transformation that took place was our creation of a Language Proficiency column to answer a section of Question 3. This was done as follows: We first selected the columns of interest. In this case, we limited our understanding of being proficient at a language to whether the respondent could carry on a conversation in English and Spanish well. Information regarding this was found in columns ‘LAN1_W58’ for Spanish and ‘LAN3_W58’ for English. Created a new column ‘LANPROF’ to encode language proficiency as Bilingual, Spanish, or English. Filled out column ‘LANPROF’ with the following definitions: Bilingual if (LAN1_W58 == ‘Pretty well’ | LAN1_W58 == ‘Very well’) &amp; (LAN3_W58 == ‘Pretty well’ | LAN3_W58 == ‘Very well’) Spanish if (LAN1_W58 == ‘Pretty well’ | LAN1_W58 == ‘Very well’) &amp; (LAN3_W58 == ‘Just a little’ | LAN3_W58 == ‘Not at all’) English if (LAN1_W58 == ‘Just a little’ | LAN1_W58 == ‘Not at all’) &amp; (LAN3_W58 == ‘Pretty well’ | LAN3_W58 == ‘Very well’) Lastly, we filtered our any possible NA values present. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We decided that quite a few of the variables included on our original database are not of interest to our research questions. Therefore. we created a new dataset that includes only 67 of the original 110 columns in our data file. These columns were selected because they include information about the respondent’s personal identity as well as political leanings and views on the term ‘Latinx’ When we run our missing patterns function on our new dataset we find that the vast majority of our variables don’t include any missing values. However, we have so many variables that our graph is very difficult to interpret. To solve this, we created a new chart by only selecting the variables that have missing values from our new database. By doing so, we can see that only 6 variables of interest contain missing data. The new graph of missing patterns is much clearer and tells us that, with the exception of the ‘HISPDIS’ variable, missing values are very common for most of these variables. ## [1] &quot;HISPORIG2_W58&quot; &quot;LATINX3_W58&quot; &quot;LATINX4_W58&quot; &quot;HISPDISCR_d_W58&quot; ## [5] &quot;YEARSINUS_W58&quot; &quot;F_PARTYLN_FINAL&quot; By taking a look at the survey set up we realized that most of those missing values are there due to the nature of the survey itself. HISPORI represents a survey question that asks participants to rank which heritage they identify with the most. However, the question is only presented if the respondent listed that they identified with more than one heritage in a previous question. Therefore, the fact that around 85% of rows are missing a value for this question means that most of the respondents identify with only 1 heritage and therefore were not presented with this question. LATINX3 and LATINX4 ask whether the respondent has ever used the word Latinx to describe themselves and whether they feel it should be used to describe the Latino/Hispanic population in general. They are only presented to a respondent if they previously answered that they have heard that word before and know its meaning. Therefore, since around 75% of rows have missing values for this variable, we can deduct that only about 25% of respondents knew the meaning of the word. YEARSIN asks how many years the respondent has lived in the US if the respondent was born outside of the US. Therefore we can tell that less than 50% of respondents where born outside of the US and were presented with this question. HISPDIS asks if the respondent has been criticized for speaking Spanish publicly, we can assume that the missing values present here represent respondents who do not speak Spanish and therefore could not answer this question. The F_PARTY variable is more complicated as it was created by the survey conductors to mark the political leaning of the respondent and is not based on a question itself. We can assume that the missing values represent reponents for which a political leaning could not be determined. However, we might look into other questions that best describe a person’s political preference if such information is needed on our analysis. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Question 1 5.2 Question 2 5.3 Question 3", " Chapter 5 Results Our exploratory data visualization for our three primary questions of interest can be found below: 5.1 Question 1 Is there a relationship between the birth status of Latin Americans in the U.S. and their political views? Are Latin Americans born in the U.S. more or less likely to support the Republican party? Moreover, for foreign-born Latin Americans, is there a relationship between their birth country and their political preferences? 5.1.1 Question 1 Results: We began our exploration of this question by exploring the proportion of survey respondents who prefer each political party. The following bar graph displays the proportion of Latinos who prefer each of the major political parties in the United States. As evidenced in this graph, the majority of Latinos, 41.25%, support the Democrat party, followed by 24.69% who support independent candidates and 21.25% who prefer the Republican party. In contrast, a Gallop poll from December 2019 (the date when our survey data was collected), found that overall, 28% of all Americans supported the Republican and Democrat parties each while 41% of Americans supported independent candidates. In comparison, we can clearly see that there seems to be a trend where Latinos support the Democratic party more heavily than the overall American population. The same Gallop poll asked those who support independent candidates whether they leaned more towards the Republican or Democrat parties and found that respondents are equally split between both. We don’t have any data regarding the leanings of Latino respondents who consider themselves independent but this could be an interesting question to explore in the future. The strong support of the Democrat party observed from this graph, however, might support the hypothesis that a similar split in preference could be found within the subgroup of Latinos who support independent candidates. https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx To explore whether this trend holds for Latinos born outside of the united states, we graphed party preference faceted on birth status. As seen in this graph, there appears to be a difference between Latinos born in the U.S. and those born outside of it with regards to their political preference. It appears that American-born Latinos are slightly more likely to support the Republican party and independent candidates than their foreign-born counterparts, who lean more heavily towards Democrats. But, do all foreign born Latino’s share the same political preferences? The flow chart below explores the proportion of foreign-born Latinos who support each political party based on their birth country. As can be seen, the two main nationalities that make up the population of foreign born Latinos in the United States are Mexican and Cuban. By hovering over the Cuban section, we can observe that they represent a considerable proportion of those who support the Republican party. In comparison, Mexican-born Latin Americans make up a proportionally much smaller subset of those who support the Republican party. The same trend seems to hold to some degree for all other nationalities. This indicates that there might be some inherent differences in the viewpoints of Cuban-born Latinos that might be interesting to explore in depth in the future. Besides nationality, we wondered if income level could be related to political preference. The flow chart below attempts to visualize this question by sub-setting foreign-born Latinos by their self-reported economic health. The flow chart shows that for every nationality, support for the Republican party is proportionally smaller as for the subset of immigrants who report their financial health to be in fair or poor shape. It is also interesting to note that although Cubans and Mexicans make up most of the foreign born residents, their proportion of respondents who reported their financial health as being in excellent shape is not significantly larger than those of other nationalities. The flow chart below serves to summarize some of our results for this question. We can see that support for each party does very with the birth country of the respondent and that the country of birth also influences political preferences. In particular, it shows that Cubans tend to be ovverly represented in thei support for the Republican party. 5.2 Question 2 Does experiencing discrimination based on ethnic identity lead to more liberal political views (as exemplified by supporting the Democratic party)? Furthermore, are people who have experienced discrimination more likely to embrace gender-neutral ways of expressing the Latin experience? 5.2.1 Question 2 Results: We begin our exploratory analysis of this question by creating a Mosaic plot mapping the relative proportions of people who have experienced ethnic discrimination against their party preference. We define experiencing ethnic discrimination as experiencing at least one of the following in the last 12 months: Been called an offensive name because of being Hispanic. Been criticized for speaking Spanish in public. Receiving a remark that they should go back to their home country. Been treated unfairly because of their Hispanic background. The graph shows that the majority of respondents have not experienced a form of ethnic discrimination in the last 12 months. It also points to a possible relationship between experiencing discrimination and the respondent’s political preferences as less respondents who have experienced discrimination support the Republican party. There does not appear to be a relationship between discrimination status and support for independent candidates. For the next section of this question, we are interested in possible relationship between having experienced discrimination and a person’s willingness to use the gender-neutral term Latinx to refer to the Latin American population. The Hypothesis is that perhaps people who experience discrimination are more aware of its discomfort and thus more willing to use terms that are more inclusive of others. To explore this, we first graph how many people in our sample have actually heard the term Latinx before. As we can see, only about 750 out of 3030 respondents have heard of this term. We will focus on the subset of respondents who have heard the term before and explore their willingness to use the term to describe themselves as well as their belief that the term should be used to describe the whole of the Hispanic population. The graph below notes the percentages of people who have heard the term Latinx before and their willingness to use it to describe themselves depending on whether they have experienced discrimination. The main observation from this graph is that, across the board, very few respondents use the term Latinx to describe themselves. However, it does appear that respondents who have experienced discrimination are about twice as likely to describe themselves as Latinx than respondents who have not experienced discrimination in the last 12 months. Although few respondents currently used ‘Latinx’, we wondered if they supported its use to describe the hispanic population as a whole. The graph below subsets the set of respondents who have heard of the term and displays their support of using the term to describe the minority broadly. As we can see, most of our respondents on either category do not support the usage of the term to describe the Hispanic population. Nevertheless, around 40% of respondents who have experienced discrimination would support it. This shows that expereincing discrimination seems to be correlated to support for use of ‘Latinx’ Our analysis of this question, however, was limited by the fact that most of the respodnents have never heard of the term ‘Latinx’ and thus the survey did not present them with questions regarding their approval of its usage to describe the whole of the Latin American community. It is possible that people who knew of the term do so because they run in more liberal circles where gender inclusiveness is encouraged and thus their support for the term was influenced by this. Not enough data is present to make any conclusive claims. It would have been helpful if the survey designers had presented a definition of ‘Latinx’ to those who have not heard of it in order to capture their views on the term and thus have more complete data. 5.3 Question 3 What influence does language proficiency have on political preference? Is there a relationship between Spanish fluency and people’s views on the importance of certain cultural signifiers to the Latin American experience? 5.3.1 Question 3 Results: To answer this question, we first needed to define what we would consider language proficiency. The data set included multiple variables detailing the respondents’ self reported proficiency at carrying out a conversation and reading a book in English and in Spanish. We decided to focus on the variables regarding conversational proficiency since we figured the ability to speak and understand the language was more important to forming cultural connections than reading ability. We created a new column and assigned a value to each respondent based on their conversational proficiency. If they self-reported being able to carry out a conversation in both English and in Spanish ‘very well’ or ‘pretty well’ we classified them as ‘Bilingual’. Otherwise, they were classified as Spanish or English speakers. The graph below plots the total number of respondents in each of our three categories. The great majority of respondents (2051) could carry out a conversation in both English and Spanish and so they were classified as bilingual. 498 respondents were only fluent in Spanish and 348 respondents were only fluent in English. Next, we explore if the distribution of party affiliation differs between the subgroups of respondents who are bilingual, strictly Spanish speakers, or strictly English speakers. The graph below shows that Bilingual respondents and English speaking respondents have very similar distributions of party affiliation. However, less Spanish speakers seem to identify with the Democratic party and instead support more independent candidates. This result seemed unexpected and so we decided to take a look at our Spanish speakers and analyze their place of birth to see if there were any insights to their political preferences. As shown below, a majority of the respondents who only speak Spanish were born in Cuba. In Question 1, we showed that Cuban tend to differ in their political affinity from the rest of Latinos and the fact that most striclty Spanish speakers are of Cuban decent could explain the observed difference in the graph above. For the last section of this question, we wanted to explore if being conversationally fluent in Spanish impacted the respondents’ opinion on what cultural signifiers were most important to the Latin American identity. We explored a series of questions that asked respondents to rate 7 cultural signifiers as either essential, important but not essential, or not important to the Latin experience. The cultural signifiers in question were: How important is speaking Spanish to what being Hispanic means to you? How important is having two Hispanic parents to what being Hispanic means to you? How important is socializing with other Hispanics to what being Hispanic means to you? How important is having a Spanish last name to what being Hispanic means to you? How important is attending Hispanic cultural events to what being Hispanic means to you? How important is being catholic to what being Hispanic means to you? How important is wearing traditional Hispanic attire to what being Hispanic means to you? We created the six mosaic plots below in order to get a quick look at possible correlations between speaking Spanish and the reported importance of these different aspects of the Hispanic identity. We also ran chi square tests for each of the cultural signifiers and found that, for all of them, the p-value was close to zero. This meant that we could reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between someone’s conversational Spanish proficiency and the importance they place on certain elements of the Latino experience. Overall, it appears that speaking Spanish and having two Hispanic parents are the most highly rated characteristics of the Hispanic Identity. How important is speaking Spanish to what being Hispanic means to you? ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: table_ds10$LAN1_W58 and table_ds10$IDENSAL_a_W58 ## X-squared = 555.96, df = 6, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 Perhaps not surprisingly, it appears that most people who have an excellent handle on conversational Spanish think speaking Spanish is an essential or important aspect of the Latino identity. This could be the basis of a hypothesis that people think of their ethnic identity in very personal terms and so define what it means to belong to a particular grouping based on their own behavior. If we had data regarding the percentage of our respondents who can answer in the affirmative to the rest of our cultural signifiers we could explore this hypothesis. However, that information was not collected and so perhaps it would be a good focus for future research. How important is having two Hispanic parents to what being Hispanic means to you? ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: table_ds10$LAN1_W58 and table_ds10$IDENSAL_e_W58 ## X-squared = 254.01, df = 6, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 Another interesting interpretation of this graph and the remeinding ones is that people who don’t speak Spanish very well tend to underplay the importance of most cultural signifiers. Very few of them think their identity is dependent on whether they speak Spanish, or whether both their parents are Hispanic. It would be interesting to explore what they concider to be the basis of the hispanic identity in future research. How important is socializing with other Hispanics to what being Hispanic means to you? ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: table_ds10$LAN1_W58 and table_ds10$IDENSAL_d_W58 ## X-squared = 156.24, df = 6, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 A possible answer to the question posed above could be gleamed from this mosaic plot. Here we can see the largest percentage of respondents who speak Spanish poorly that have rated a social signifier as important. They comparatively seem to think socializing with other Hispanics is more important than the other signifiers. How important is having a Spanish last name to what being Hispanic means to you? ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: table_ds10$LAN1_W58 and table_ds10$IDENSAL_f_W58 ## X-squared = 83.397, df = 6, p-value = 7.088e-16 From this plot on, we can see that the proportion of respondent who think the remainding cultural signifiers are important has started to shrink. It appears not as many respondents think having a Spanish last name is as essential as speaking Spanish or having a genetic or cultural link to the Hispanic population. How important is attending Hispanic cultural events to what being Hispanic means to you? ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: table_ds10$LAN1_W58 and table_ds10$IDENSAL_b_W58 ## X-squared = 65.059, df = 6, p-value = 4.196e-12 A similar pattern to the once above can be seen in this plot. How important is being catholic to what being Hispanic means to you? ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: table_ds10$LAN1_W58 and table_ds10$IDENSAL_g_W58 ## X-squared = 43.13, df = 6, p-value = 1.099e-07 Being Catholic is the first cultural signifier that most of the respondents agree is not an important aspect of the Hispanic identity. Most of our respondents have origins in deeply catholic countries and and the fact that the importance of this religious belief to their identity is not considered as essential as others could point out to changing attitudes towards religion. This would be another interesting aspect to explore in future research. How important is wearing traditional Hispanic attire to what being Hispanic means to you? ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: table_ds10$LAN1_W58 and table_ds10$IDENSAL_c_W58 ## X-squared = 29.679, df = 6, p-value = 4.523e-05 Wearing traditional ethnic attire is the least important cultural signifier of the Hispanic identity according to our respondents. Although a pattern still holds that those who speak Spanish believe it is more important than respondents who don’t. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion As mentioned in previous chapters, the main limitation of our research was the nature of the data. Since all information was collected thorough a survey we only had access to categorical data. This limited the visualizations we could use and also led to somewhat simplified results. An example of this could be found on the analysis of economic health on political preference found on Question 1. We only had access to a self-reported grading from ‘In excellent shape’ to ‘In poor shape’. It would have been great to instead have access to data indicating the actual income levels of respondents rather than vague, poorly defined, definitions of economic health. Another limitation was the fact that the survey only included adults over 18 years old in its target population. A lot of our questions dealt with the question of what constitutes the Latin American experience and excluding such a connected and active part of the Latin American population presented a very limited view of Latin American views of identity and political preferences. We wouldn’t be surprised if younger Latinos were much more aware of gender-neutral terms to describe their identity and more open to different interpretations of what it means to be a Latino. Exploring the views of younger Latinos would be a great topic for future research. Moreover, pointed out on the last sections of Question 3, more research exploring what Latinos believe is an important aspect of their identity would open the path for a more holistic, and much less simplistic, understanding of their political preferences and embitions.
