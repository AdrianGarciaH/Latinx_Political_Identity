In the current political climate, one often hears references to the Latino vote, an assumption that claims Latin Americans act as one. In reality, the Latin American population is highly diverse and composed of immigrants from many countries in South America as well as a large population of American born Latin American citizens. We hope to explore the multiple facets of the Latin American experience and display the diversity and intersectionality of the largest minority group in the country. Specifically, we want to explore whether different subgroups of Latin Americans have different political preferences. To guide this work, we have decided to focus on the following questions: Is there a relationship between the birth status of Latin Americans in the U.S. and their political views? Are Latin Americans born in the U.S. more or less likely to support the Republican party? Moreover, for foreign-born Latin Americans, is there a relationship between their birth country and their political preferences? Does experiencing discrimination based on ethnic identity lead to more liberal political views (as exemplified by supporting the Democratic party)? Furthermore, are people who have experienced discrimination more likely to embrace gender-neutral ways of expressing the Latin experience? What influence does language proficiency have on political preference? Is there a relationship between Spanish fluency and people’s views on the importance of certain cultural signifiers to the Latin American experience? To explore these questions, we’ve produced a series of visualizations using data collected through a large survey of Latin Americans by the Pew Research Center. In the next few chapters, we will discuss our data source, data manipulations, and the results of our exploratory analysis. A note on terminology: The terms Latin American, Latino, Hispanic, and Latinx will be used interchangeably to refer to the population of residents of the United States who trace their origins or descent to any county of Latin America. Latinx is a gender-neutral alternative to the gendered forms Latino/Latina that is not recognized by the Royal Spanish Academy of Language but is nonetheless used by speakers wishing to use a more inclusive term to describe themselves. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Survey Origins 2.2 Target Population 2.3 Dataset Description 2.4 Issues With Our Data", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Survey Origins The source of data for this project was the 2019 National Survey of Latinos carried out by the Ipsos Public Affairs Research institute on behalf of the Pew Research Center. The Pew Research Center conducts public opinion polling and demographic research with the goal of informing the American public about the trends and issues at the forefront of the American political and social climate. They are non-partisan, self-described ‘fact thank’, non-profit organization and therefore a reliable, unbiased source of information. This survey was the 58th wave of the American Trends Panel survey and consisted of 3030 panel members who were presented with an extensive survey in a mostly digital format from December 3, 2019 to December 22, 2019. It was presented both in English and Spanish depending on the respondents’ preference and thus encompasses the views of Latino’s who are not English speakers. 2.2 Target Population The target population for the survey consisted of non-institutionalized adults (age 18 and over), residing in the United States. The sample was chosen through KnowledgePanel, an online, probability-based recruitment tool that allowed for a random selection of survey takers so that the results can be said to properly represent the U.S. Hispanic population. 2.3 Dataset Description The dataset itself includes 3030 entries, one for each survey participant. It contains 110 columns or variables encoding a response to each of the questions presented on the survey. All responses are encoded as factors (with the exception of the respondent’s age and, if born outside the U.S., the number of years residing in the U.S.). It includes information on such topics as the respondents political preference, ethnic self-identification, birth status, age, educational level, Spanish and English proficiency, expereince with ethinic-based discrimination, opinions regarding the importance of particular cultural signifiers, and broad opinions about the Trump administration. For our project, we decided to ignore the data regarding the Trump administration. We were mostly interested in overall political preference and felt equating political preference with approval of the Trump administration would skew our results due to the controversial nature of the Trump administration. Once this information was filtered out, we were left with a dataset of 3030 entries and 67 possible variables of interest to explore. 2.4 Issues With Our Data The main issue with this dataset was the fact that the great majority of variables included are categorical and thus limited our graph visualization possibilities. Moreover, certain variables such as political preference were constructed by the survey administrators based on the respondents’ responses to previous questions. Therefore there is a possibility that political preference assigned to a respondent might not completely align with the respondent’s political self-identification. However, we have no reason to fear there was bias in the assignment of political preference as the Pew Research Institute is a non-partisan organization. A possible other source of bias on our analysis of political preference came from the nature of the survey sample since only residents over 18 years old were included. This means that we don’t have data on younger generations of Latin Americans. Therefore, we are not able to explore whether the generations that will come into voting age in the next few years have a preference for a political party over another. Moreover, since there is a probability that younger respondents are more open to gender-neutral terms such as Latinx, our analysis of the approval of this term by the Latin American population is somewhat flawed. Lastly, as explored in the Missing Data chapter, the survey was constructed in such a way that certain questions were only presented to some respondents conditionally. Meaning that a negative response on a gateway question resulted in multiple ‘NA’ values on subsequent questions. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We decided that quite a few of the variables included on our original database are not of interest to our research questions. Therefore. we created a new dataset that includes only 67 of the original 110 columns in our data file. These columns were selected because they include information about the respondent’s personal identity as well as political leanings and views on the term ‘Latinx’ When we run our missing patterns function on our new dataset we find that the vast majority of our variables don’t include any missing values. However, we have so many variables that our graph is very difficult to interpret. To solve this, we created a new chart by only selecting the variables that have missing values from our new database. By doing so, we can see that only 6 variables of interest contain missing data. The new graph of missing patterns is much clearer and tells us that, with the exception of the ‘HISPDIS’ variable, missing values are very common for most of these variables. ## [1] &quot;HISPORIG2_W58&quot; &quot;LATINX3_W58&quot; &quot;LATINX4_W58&quot; &quot;HISPDISCR_d_W58&quot; ## [5] &quot;YEARSINUS_W58&quot; &quot;F_PARTYLN_FINAL&quot; By taking a look at the survey set up we realized that most of those missing values are there due to the nature of the survey itself. HISPORI represents a survey question that asks participants to rank which heritage they identify with the most. However, the question is only presented if the respondent listed that they identified with more than one heritage in a previous question. Therefore, the fact that around 85% of rows are missing a value for this question means that most of the respondents identify with only 1 heritage and therefore were not presented with this question. LATINX3 and LATINX4 ask whether the respondent has ever used the word Latinx to describe themselves and whether they feel it should be used to describe the Latino/Hispanic population in general. They are only presented to a respondent if they previously answered that they have heard that word before and know its meaning. Therefore, since around 75% of rows have missing values for this variable, we can deduct that only about 25% of respondents knew the meaning of the word. YEARSIN asks how many years the respondent has lived in the US if the respondent was born outside of the US. Therefore we can tell that less than 50% of respondents where born outside of the US and were presented with this question. HISPDIS asks if the respondent has been criticized for speaking Spanish publicly, we can assume that the missing values present here represent respondents who do not speak Spanish and therefore could not answer this question. The F_PARTY variable is more complicated as it was created by the survey conductors to mark the political leaning of the respondent and is not based on a question itself. We can assume that the missing values represent reponents for which a political leaning could not be determined. However, we might look into other questions that best describe a person’s political preference if such information is needed on our analysis.
